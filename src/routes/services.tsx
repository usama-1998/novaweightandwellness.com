        <p>
          For women 35 to 55 who feel like their body has changed. Tired even after sleep. Foggy
          at work. Dealing with hormone shifts, cravings or crashes, and stubborn weight that
          won't budge. You keep getting told your labs are "normal," and you're left frustrated,
          wondering why you can't figure it out.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          This 6-month program replaces guessing with clarity. We look at the full picture, your
          symptoms, patterns, and deeper root causes, then build a personalized plan that helps
          your body restore steady energy, reduce inflammation, and get your metabolism responding
          again. The goal isn't perfection. It's understanding your body and never "starting over
          every Monday" again.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 font-medium text-foreground">Your care plan focuses on 4 non-negotiables:</p>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Nutrition + blood sugar stability (steady energy, fewer crashes, calmer cravings)</li>
          <li>Sleep + circadian rhythm (better sleep, clearer thinking, easier mornings)</li>
          <li>Stress + nervous system regulation (less wired-and-tired, more calm and steady)</li>
          <li>Movement + metabolic strength (strength and insulin sensitivity without punishing workouts)</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-3 font-medium text-foreground">Includes:</p>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Bi-monthly consultations with a healthcare provider</li>
          <li>48-hour response time for inquiries</li>
