            <p>
              For years, I battled relentless fatigue and brain fog, only to be told by doctors that
              everything was "fine." That dismissal became my turning point.
            </p>
            <p>
              I dove into functional medicine to find the answers I was denied uncovering how
              stress, nutrition, and metabolic health intersect. Now, I partner with women in
              midlife to solve the root causes of their symptoms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through personalized nutrition and whole-person care, I help you move past the
              "something is off" feeling and back into a life of confidence and vitality.
